 *          - Dynamic registers - Temporary volatile changes to chip configuration
 *          - Mailbox - 256 bytes of fast memory for direct data streaming
 *          - System registers - Configuration of chip, non-volatile, password protected
 *                             - Also contains reads only device information like ID, etc
